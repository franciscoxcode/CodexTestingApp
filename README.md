Tasky Crush is a **SwiftUI** productivity companion that organizes your to-dos into project ‚Äústories‚Äù and day filters while handing out shiny coin points whenever you clear a task. Capture tasks with tags, due dates, reminders, and repeating rules, spin up emoji-colored projects on the fly, and jump into markdown notes or your completed history without leaving the home screen.

## üîß Features 

- Organize tasks into emoji-colored ‚Äústories‚Äù with custom tags, color accents, and a drag-to-reorder manager so your projects stay in the order that makes sense to you.
- Capture rich task details like due dates, recurrence rules, reminders, and markdown notes, so every to-do has the context it needs.
- Filter your day by inbox or project and zero in on today, tomorrow, the weekend, or any custom date while overdue tasks automatically roll forward and recurring items schedule their next appearance.
- Stay motivated with a live coin badge, instant point rewards on completion, and a full completed-history sheet that lets you reschedule, edit, and note-take without leaving the flow.
- Work quickly through inline sheets for adding tasks, managing projects, picking emojis, and opening the markdown note editor right from the main screen.

## Stack Used

- **SwiftUI** app entry point hosting the main content scene, backed by the HomeViewModel state container.
- Combine-powered observable model that publishes task/project changes and persists them automatically.
- A custom UIKit-backed markdown editor wrapped for SwiftUI to handle rich note-taking features.
- Local notification tooling wired up at launch to request permission, schedule reminders, and surface alerts in the foreground.
- File-based JSON persistence for tasks and projects plus UserDefaults tracking for the user‚Äôs point total, keeping progress intact between launches.

## üß™ Highlighted Technical Detail

When you finish a repeating task, Tasky Crush doesn‚Äôt just clone it, it pipes the completed item through a custom recurrence engine that respects weekday/weekend scopes, month-length clamping, and even minute-level intervals, then aligns the next reminder time before broadcasting the freshly generated occurrence back to the UI via Combine so you can accept or tweak it immediately.
